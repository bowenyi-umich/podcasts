Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/MiniLM-L12-H384-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
/opt/anaconda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/nn/parallel/data_parallel.py:32: UserWarning:
    There is an imbalance between your GPUs. You may want to exclude GPU 2 which
    has less than 75% of the memory or cores of GPU 0. You can do so by setting
    the device_ids argument to DataParallel, or by setting the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
    environment variable.
