Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/MiniLM-L12-H384-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
